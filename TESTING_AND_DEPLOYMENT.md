## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing and deployment plan for the Codopia platform's migration to a new Supabase and Vercel-based architecture. The successful execution of this plan is critical to ensure a seamless, secure, and high-quality user experience. This plan covers all phases of testing, from unit and integration testing to user acceptance testing (UAT) and post-deployment monitoring.

## 2. Testing Strategy

A multi-layered testing strategy will be employed to ensure the quality and reliability of the new platform.

### 2.1. Unit Testing

*   **Objective:** To test individual components and functions in isolation.
*   **Tools:** Jest and React Testing Library for the frontend, and pytest for any backend Python scripts.
*   **Scope:**
    *   All authentication-related functions in `src/lib/auth.ts`.
    *   All child management functions in `src/lib/children.ts`.
    *   All security-related functions in `src/lib/security.ts`.
    *   All React components, including `ChildCard.tsx`, `SignInPage.tsx`, and `SignUpPage.tsx`.

### 2.2. Integration Testing

*   **Objective:** To test the interaction between different components and services.
*   **Tools:** Cypress for end-to-end testing of user flows.
*   **Scope:**
    *   User registration and login flows.
    *   Parent and child account creation and management.
    *   Tier assignment and content access.
    *   RLS policy enforcement.

### 2.3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

*   **Objective:** To validate the new platform against user requirements and expectations.
*   **Participants:** A select group of internal and external users.
*   **Scope:**
    *   End-to-end testing of all user-facing features.
    *   Feedback on usability, performance, and overall experience.

### 2.4. Performance Testing

*   **Objective:** To ensure the new platform can handle the expected load and performs well under stress.
*   **Tools:** k6 or a similar load testing tool.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Authentication endpoint response times.
    *   Database query performance.
    *   Page load times.




## 3. Deployment Plan

A phased deployment approach will be used to minimize risk and ensure a smooth transition.

### 3.1. Staging Environment

A dedicated staging environment that mirrors the production environment will be used for all pre-production testing. This environment will be connected to a separate Supabase project to avoid any impact on production data.

### 3.2. Production Deployment

The production deployment will be executed in the following steps:

1.  **Database Migration:** The database migration scripts will be run to migrate all data from the legacy database to the new Supabase database.
2.  **Application Deployment:** The new Next.js application will be deployed to Vercel.
3.  **DNS Switch:** The DNS records will be updated to point to the new Vercel deployment.
4.  **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** The platform will be closely monitored for any issues or errors.

## 4. Rollback Plan

In the event of a critical failure during or after deployment, the following rollback plan will be executed:

1.  **DNS Revert:** The DNS records will be reverted to point back to the legacy Flask application.
2.  **Database Restore:** If necessary, the Supabase database will be restored from the pre-migration backup.
3.  **Root Cause Analysis:** A thorough investigation will be conducted to identify the cause of the failure.

## 5. Post-Deployment

### 5.1. Monitoring and Alerting

Comprehensive monitoring and alerting will be set up to track the health and performance of the new platform. This will include:

*   **Uptime Monitoring:** To ensure the platform is always available.
*   **Error Tracking:** To quickly identify and diagnose any errors.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** To track page load times, API response times, and other key performance indicators.

### 5.2. User Feedback

A system for collecting and responding to user feedback will be established. This will help to identify any issues or areas for improvement.
