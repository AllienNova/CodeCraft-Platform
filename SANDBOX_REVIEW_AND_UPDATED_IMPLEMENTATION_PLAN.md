#### üö® CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

##### 1. **Database Integration Gap**
- **Current**: In-memory user storage in Flask (`users = []`)
- **Required**: Supabase PostgreSQL integration
- **Impact**: No persistent user data, progress tracking, or scalability

##### 2. **Authentication System Disconnect**
- **Current**: Separate Flask auth and Next.js frontend
- **Required**: Unified authentication with session management
- **Impact**: Users can't seamlessly move between marketing site and learning environment

##### 3. **Learning Environment Incomplete**
- **Current**: Magic Workshop demo working locally only
- **Required**: Production deployment with all three tiers
- **Impact**: Only basic functionality available, no complete learning experience

##### 4. **Deployment Issues**
- **Current**: Multiple failed deployments, routing conflicts
- **Required**: Stable production deployment
- **Impact**: Platform not accessible to users consistently

##### 5. **Professor Sparkle Integration Partial**
- **Current**: Multiple implementations, fallback system only
- **Required**: Full Gemini Live API with voice interaction
- **Impact**: AI tutor not providing full conversational experience
