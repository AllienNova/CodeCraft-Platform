# Codopia Platform: Scalable Tier Architecture Design

This document outlines the scalable tier architecture for the Codopia platform, designed to support multiple learning tiers and facilitate the seamless addition of new modules.

## 1. Core Principles

- **Scalability**: The architecture must easily accommodate new tiers and modules without requiring major refactoring.
- **Modularity**: Each tier and module should be self-contained to the greatest extent possible.
- **Consistency**: A consistent structure across tiers will simplify development and maintenance.
- **Flexibility**: The system should allow for tier-specific UI/UX, logic, and content.

## 2. Directory Structure

The following directory structure will be adopted to organize the platform by tiers and modules:

```
/codopia-platform
|-- backend
|   |-- templates
|   |   |-- learning
|   |   |   |-- tier1
|   |   |   |   |-- module1.html
|   |   |   |   |-- module2.html
|   |   |   |-- tier2
|   |   |   |   |-- module1.html
|   |   |   |-- tier3
|   |   |   |   |-- module1.html
|   |-- static
|   |   |-- css
|   |   |   |-- tier1.css
|   |   |   |-- tier2.css
|   |   |   |-- tier3.css
|   |   |-- js
|   |   |   |-- tier1_module1.js
|   |   |   |-- tier2_module1.js
|   |   |   |-- tier3_module1.js
|-- ...
```

## 3. Routing System

The Flask backend will use a dynamic routing system to serve the correct tier and module:

```python
@app.route("/learning/<tier>/<module>")
def learning_module(tier, module):
    # Logic to check user access and serve the correct template
    return render_template(f"learning/{tier}/{module}.html")
```

This allows for URLs like:
- `/learning/tier1/module1`
- `/learning/tier2/module1`

## 4. Tier-Specific Content

- **HTML Templates**: Each tier will have its own set of HTML templates, allowing for unique layouts and features.
- **CSS Stylesheets**: Tier-specific CSS files will control the visual appearance of each tier.
- **JavaScript Logic**: Module-specific JavaScript files will contain the logic for challenges and interactions.

## 5. Beta Launch Plan

- **Tier 1**: The existing Magic Workshop will serve as Module 1.
- **Tier 2**: A new interface will be created for ages 8-10, with a focus on text-based coding concepts.
- **Tier 3**: A more advanced interface for ages 11-13, introducing more complex programming paradigms.

This architecture provides a robust and scalable foundation for the Codopia platform, enabling us to build a comprehensive learning experience for a wide range of age groups.
