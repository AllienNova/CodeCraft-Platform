# Legacy Files

This directory contains the original implementation files from the Codopia platform development:

## Files

- `main_new.py` - Original Flask backend with JWT authentication
- `App_enhanced.jsx` - Original React frontend with authentication forms

## Purpose

These files are preserved for reference and to understand the migration from the original Flask/JWT implementation to the current Supabase/Next.js architecture.

## Usage

These files are for historical reference only. The current implementation is in the main project directories:
- `backend/` - Current Flask backend
- `frontend/` - Current Next.js frontend
