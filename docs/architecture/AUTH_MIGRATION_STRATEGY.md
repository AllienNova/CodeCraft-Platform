## 1. Introduction & Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for migrating the Codopia platform's existing Flask-based authentication system to the modern, secure, and scalable Supabase Auth. The primary objective of this migration is to seamlessly transition all user accounts, including parent and child relationships, while enhancing security, improving the user experience, and laying a robust foundation for future growth. This migration is a critical step in the broader platform evolution from a monolithic Flask application to a distributed, high-performance architecture leveraging Supabase and Vercel.

The legacy system, built on Flask and a custom JWT implementation with bcrypt password hashing, has served the platform well but presents limitations in scalability, maintainability, and the ability to rapidly integrate modern security features. Supabase Auth, a managed authentication service built on top of PostgreSQL, offers a rich set of features including social logins, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and fine-grained access control through Row Level Security (RLS), which will significantly elevate Codopia's security posture.

This migration will be executed with a zero-downtime approach for end-users, ensuring a smooth and transparent transition. The strategy detailed herein covers every aspect of the migration, from data mapping and schema design to the implementation of custom logic for preserving the unique parent-child account structure and age-based tier assignments. By the end of this migration, Codopia will have a state-of-the-art authentication system that is not only more secure and scalable but also provides a more streamlined and enjoyable user experience.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

The primary goals of this authentication migration are as follows:

*   **Seamless User Transition:** Users must be able to log in with their existing credentials without any interruption or need for manual account recreation. The migration process should be entirely transparent to the end-user.
*   **Preservation of Core Functionality:** All existing authentication-related features, including parent and child account relationships and age-based tier assignments, must be fully preserved and functional in the new system.
*   **Enhanced Security:** The new authentication system will leverage Supabase's built-in security features, including Row Level Security (RLS), to provide a more secure and robust platform. This will include the implementation of fine-grained access control policies to protect user data.
*   **Improved User Experience (UX):** The migration will provide an opportunity to enhance the user experience by implementing modern authentication patterns, such as social logins (Google, etc.) and a more streamlined registration and login flow.
*   **Scalability & Maintainability:** The new Supabase-based authentication system will be more scalable and easier to maintain than the legacy Flask implementation, allowing for the rapid development and deployment of new features.
*   **Future-Proofing:** By adopting a modern, managed authentication service, Codopia will be well-positioned to adapt to future security challenges and evolving user expectations.




## 3. Detailed Migration Strategy

### 3.1. Phased Rollout

The migration will be conducted in a phased manner to minimize risk and ensure a smooth transition. The following phases are proposed:

*   **Phase 1: Silent User Data Migration.** In this phase, we will migrate all existing user data from the Flask application's database to the Supabase database. This will be a one-time, offline process. We will extract user data (including hashed passwords), transform it into the new schema, and load it into Supabase. Bcrypt password hashes will be migrated directly, as Supabase supports bcrypt.
*   **Phase 2: Dual Authentication.** For a limited period, both the legacy Flask authentication and the new Supabase authentication will run in parallel. New user registrations will be handled by Supabase Auth. Existing users will be authenticated against the migrated data in Supabase. This will allow us to test the new system with live traffic while having the old system as a fallback.
*   **Phase 3: Full Cutover.** Once we are confident in the stability and performance of the new system, we will fully cut over to Supabase Auth. The legacy Flask authentication endpoints will be deprecated and eventually removed.

### 3.2. User and Password Migration

The existing Flask application uses bcrypt to hash user passwords. Supabase's `auth.users` table also supports bcrypt, which simplifies the password migration process. We will create a custom script to extract user data from the Flask database and import it into Supabase. This script will:

1.  Connect to the Flask application's database.
2.  Iterate through the `User` table.
3.  For each user, create a corresponding user in Supabase using the `supabase.auth.admin.createUser()` function.
4.  The `password_hash` from the Flask database will be directly imported to the `raw_user_meta_data` field in the Supabase `auth.users` table. Supabase will automatically recognize and use the bcrypt hash for authentication.

### 3.3. Parent-Child Relationship Migration

The parent-child relationship is a core feature of the Codopia platform. The existing Flask application manages this relationship through a `parent_id` foreign key in the `ChildProfile` table. We will replicate this structure in the Supabase database. The migration process will involve:

1.  Migrating all parent `User` accounts to the `profiles` table in Supabase.
2.  Migrating all `ChildProfile` records to the `children` table in Supabase.
3.  Ensuring that the `parent_id` in the `children` table correctly references the `id` of the corresponding parent in the `profiles` table.

### 3.4. Tier Assignment Logic

The existing application determines a child's tier based on their age. This logic will be replicated in the new system. We will create a Supabase database function, `determine_tier(age)`, that will be triggered whenever a new child is created or a child's age is updated. This function will ensure that the `tier` field in the `children` table is always up-to-date.

### 3.5. JWT to Supabase Auth Session Migration

The legacy system uses Flask-JWT-Extended for session management. The new system will use Supabase's built-in session management. When a user logs in through the new system, Supabase will issue a new JWT. The frontend will be updated to store this new JWT and use it for all subsequent API requests to the Supabase backend.

## 4. Enhanced Security with Row Level Security (RLS)

Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) is a powerful feature that allows us to define fine-grained access control policies directly in the database. We will leverage RLS to ensure that users can only access the data they are authorized to see. The following RLS policies will be implemented:

*   **Users can only view and edit their own profile.**
*   **Parents can only view and manage their own children's profiles.**
*   **Children can only view their own profile and learning materials.**
*   **Anonymous users have no access to any user data.**

These policies will be implemented as SQL statements in a migration file and applied to the Supabase database.



## 5. Technical Implementation Details

### 5.1. Database Schema Mapping

The migration requires careful mapping between the existing Flask SQLAlchemy models and the new Supabase schema. The following table outlines the key mappings:

| Flask Model | Flask Field | Supabase Table | Supabase Field | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| User | id | profiles | id | UUID in Supabase vs Integer in Flask |
| User | email | profiles | email | Direct mapping |
| User | password_hash | auth.users | encrypted_password | Bcrypt hash migration |
| User | role | profiles | role | Enum type in Supabase |
| User | created_at | profiles | created_at | Timestamp with timezone |
| ChildProfile | id | children | id | UUID in Supabase |
| ChildProfile | name | children | name | Direct mapping |
| ChildProfile | age | children | age | Direct mapping |
| ChildProfile | parent_id | children | parent_id | Foreign key relationship |
| ChildProfile | tier | children | tier | Enum type mapping |
| Project | id | projects | id | UUID in Supabase |
| Progress | id | lesson_progress | id | Enhanced progress tracking |

### 5.2. Authentication Flow Redesign

The new authentication flow will leverage Supabase's built-in capabilities while maintaining the existing user experience:

**Parent Registration Flow:**
1. User submits registration form with email and password
2. Supabase Auth creates user account with email verification
3. Custom trigger creates profile record in `profiles` table
4. User receives verification email and completes account setup
5. Redirect to dashboard for child profile creation

**Child Profile Creation Flow:**
1. Parent creates child profile with name and age
2. System automatically determines tier based on age using database function
3. Child record created in `children` table with proper parent relationship
4. Child-specific authentication token generated for learning sessions

**Login Flow:**
1. User enters credentials on login page
2. Supabase Auth validates credentials
3. System checks user role and redirects appropriately
4. Parent users see dashboard with child management
5. Child users enter learning environment directly

### 5.3. Data Migration Scripts

The migration will be executed through a series of carefully orchestrated scripts:

**Script 1: User Data Extraction**
```python
# Extract users from Flask database
def extract_flask_users():
    users = db.session.query(User).all()
    return [{
        'email': user.email,
        'password_hash': user.password_hash,
        'role': user.role,
        'created_at': user.created_at,
        'flask_id': user.id
    } for user in users]
```

**Script 2: Supabase User Creation**
```python
# Create users in Supabase with preserved passwords
def migrate_user_to_supabase(user_data):
    response = supabase.auth.admin.create_user({
        'email': user_data['email'],
        'password': user_data['password_hash'],
        'email_confirm': True,
        'user_metadata': {
            'role': user_data['role'],
            'migrated_from_flask': True,
            'original_flask_id': user_data['flask_id']
        }
    })
    return response
```

**Script 3: Profile and Children Migration**
```python
# Migrate profiles and children with proper relationships
def migrate_profiles_and_children():
    for user in migrated_users:
        # Create profile
        profile_data = {
            'id': user['supabase_id'],
            'email': user['email'],
            'role': user['role'],
            'created_at': user['created_at']
        }
        supabase.table('profiles').insert(profile_data).execute()
        
        # Migrate children if parent
        if user['role'] == 'parent':
            children = get_flask_children(user['flask_id'])
            for child in children:
                child_data = {
                    'parent_id': user['supabase_id'],
                    'name': child['name'],
                    'age': child['age'],
                    'tier': determine_tier(child['age']),
                    'created_at': child['created_at']
                }
                supabase.table('children').insert(child_data).execute()
```

### 5.4. Row Level Security Implementation

Comprehensive RLS policies will be implemented to ensure data security:

**Profile Access Policy:**
```sql
-- Users can only access their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON profiles
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON profiles
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

**Children Access Policy:**
```sql
-- Parents can manage their children
CREATE POLICY "Parents can view their children" ON children
    FOR SELECT USING (
        auth.uid() IN (
            SELECT id FROM profiles 
            WHERE id = children.parent_id 
            AND role = 'parent'
        )
    );

CREATE POLICY "Parents can manage their children" ON children
    FOR ALL USING (
        auth.uid() IN (
            SELECT id FROM profiles 
            WHERE id = children.parent_id 
            AND role = 'parent'
        )
    );
```

**Project Access Policy:**
```sql
-- Children can access their own projects
CREATE POLICY "Children can access own projects" ON projects
    FOR ALL USING (
        child_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM children 
            WHERE parent_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

### 5.5. Frontend Integration Strategy

The Next.js frontend will be updated to seamlessly integrate with Supabase Auth:

**Authentication Context Provider:**
```typescript
// Enhanced auth context with parent-child support
export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
    const [user, setUser] = useState(null)
    const [profile, setProfile] = useState(null)
    const [childProfiles, setChildProfiles] = useState([])
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

    useEffect(() => {
        // Listen for auth state changes
        const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(
            async (event, session) => {
                if (session?.user) {
                    await loadUserProfile(session.user.id)
                } else {
                    setUser(null)
                    setProfile(null)
                    setChildProfiles([])
                }
                setLoading(false)
            }
        )

        return () => subscription.unsubscribe()
    }, [])

    const loadUserProfile = async (userId) => {
        // Load user profile and children
        const { data: profile } = await supabase
            .from('profiles')
            .select('*')
            .eq('id', userId)
            .single()

        if (profile?.role === 'parent') {
            const { data: children } = await supabase
                .from('children')
                .select('*')
                .eq('parent_id', userId)
            setChildProfiles(children || [])
        }

        setProfile(profile)
    }
}
```

**Enhanced Registration Component:**
```typescript
// Multi-step registration with child profile creation
export const EnhancedRegistration = () => {
    const [step, setStep] = useState(1)
    const [parentData, setParentData] = useState({})
    const [childrenData, setChildrenData] = useState([])

    const handleParentRegistration = async (formData) => {
        const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
            email: formData.email,
            password: formData.password,
            options: {
                data: {
                    full_name: formData.fullName,
                    role: 'parent'
                }
            }
        })
        
        if (!error) {
            setParentData(data)
            setStep(2)
        }
    }

    const handleChildProfileCreation = async (childData) => {
        const { data, error } = await supabase
            .from('children')
            .insert({
                parent_id: parentData.user.id,
                name: childData.name,
                age: childData.age,
                tier: determineTier(childData.age)
            })
        
        if (!error) {
            setChildrenData([...childrenData, data[0]])
        }
    }
}
```
